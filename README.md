# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is my solution to the "Rock-Paper-Scissors" project from freeCodeCamp's Machine Learning with Python Certification.

I used a simple reinforcement learning approach (Q-learning algorithm) to allow my "player" function to defeat the other preprogrammed players.
The code was cloned from https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-rock-paper-scissors.git and I've changed the RPS.py file to improve the player.
